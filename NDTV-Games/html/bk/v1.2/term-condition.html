                                        the limitations of liability set forth herein, that the

                                        set forth herein reflect a reasonable and fair
                                        allocation of risk between You and NDTV Games, and that
                                        the warranty disclaimers and the limitations of

                                        will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by
